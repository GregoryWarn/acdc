# Alter Core Dice Configuration
A small module to set Foundry core dice configuration.

For now it toggles between Manual rolls and auto rolls for all dice, when a user clicks the R button inserted in the left sidebar of Foundry in Token Controls.

The button will only be shown if the user has a role with permission to make manual rolls in the first place.
