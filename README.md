# Alter Core Dice Configuration

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/Y8Y8EFVYB)

A small module to set Foundry core dice configuration.

Quickly toggles between Manual rolls and auto rolls for all dice, when a user clicks the R button inserted in the left sidebar of Foundry in Token Controls.

The button will only be shown if the user has a role with permission to make manual rolls in the first place.

How to use!
